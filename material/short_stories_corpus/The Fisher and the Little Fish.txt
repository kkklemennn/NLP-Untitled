The Fisher and the Little Fish
It happened that a Fisher, after fishing all day, caught only a
little fish. ‘Pray, let me go, master,’ said the Fish. ‘I am much
too small for your eating just now. If you put me back into
the river I shall soon grow, then you can make a fine meal
off me.’
‘Nay, nay, my little Fish,’ said the Fisher, ‘I have you now.
I may not catch you hereafter.’
A little thing in hand is worth more than a great thing
in prospect.

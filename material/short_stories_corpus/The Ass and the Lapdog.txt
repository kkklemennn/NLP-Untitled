The Ass and the Lapdog
A Farmer one day came to the stables to see to his beasts
of burden: among them was his favourite Ass, that was always well fed and often carried his master. With the Farmer
came his Lapdog, who danced about and licked his hand
and frisked about as happy as could be. The Farmer felt in
his pocket, gave the Lapdog some dainty food, and sat down
while he gave his orders to his servants. The Lapdog jumped
into his master’s lap, and lay there blinking while the Farmer stroked his ears. The Ass, seeing this, broke loose from
his halter and commenced prancing about in imitation of
the Lapdog. The Farmer could not hold his sides with laughter, so the Ass went up to him, and putting his feet upon
the Farmer’s shoulder attempted to climb into his lap. The
Farmer’s servants rushed up with sticks and pitchforks and
soon taught the Ass that clumsy jesting is no joke.

The Wolf and the Kid
A Kid was perched up on the top of a house, and looking
down saw a Wolf passing under him. Immediately he began
to revile and attack his enemy. ‘Murderer and thief,’ he cried,
‘what do you here near honest folks’ houses? How dare you
make an appearance where your vile deeds are known?’
‘Curse away, my young friend,’ said the Wolf.
‘It is easy to be brave from a safe distance.’

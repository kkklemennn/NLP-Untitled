The Bald Man and the Fly
There was once a Bald Man who sat down after work on a
hot summer’s day. A Fly came up and kept buzzing about
his bald pate, and stinging him from time to time. The Man
aimed a blow at his little enemy, but acks palm came on his
head instead; again the Fly tormented him, but this time
the Man was wiser and said:
‘You will only injure yourself if you take notice of despicable enemies.’

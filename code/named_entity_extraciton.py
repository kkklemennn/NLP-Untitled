text = """The Fox and the Crow
A Fox once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its
beak and settle on a branch of a tree. ‘That’s for me, as I
am a Fox,’ said Master Reynard, and he walked up to the
foot of the tree. ‘Good-day, Mistress Crow,’ he cried. ‘How
well you are looking to-day: how glossy your feathers; how
bright your eye. I feel sure your voice must surpass that of
other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear but one
song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds.’
The Crow lifted up her head and began to caw her best, but
the moment she opened her mouth the piece of cheese fell
to the ground, only to be snapped up by Master Fox. ‘That
will do,’ said he. ‘That was all I wanted. In exchange for your
cheese I will give you a piece of advice for the future .’Do
not trust flatterers.’"""
